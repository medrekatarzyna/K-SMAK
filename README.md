This project involves the design of a business card for K-SMAK, a traditional confectionery established in 1989. The card reflects the brandâ€™s heritage and focus on high-quality baked goods and desserts, combining clean aesthetics with functional design. Created with a minimalist approach, the layout ensures clarity and effective communication of essential information.
Several versions of the business card were created, each tailored to different stylistic approaches, and they are included in a separate file. The final design was developed through discussions with the client to align with their vision and preferences, ensuring a result that meets their expectations and effectively represents the brand.
