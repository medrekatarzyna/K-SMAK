This project involves the design of a business card for K-SMAK, a traditional confectionery established in 1989. The card reflects the brandâ€™s heritage and focus on high-quality baked goods and desserts, combining clean aesthetics with functional design. Created with a minimalist approach, the layout ensures clarity and effective communication of essential information.
